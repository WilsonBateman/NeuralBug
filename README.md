# NeuralBug
 
# I've begun designing an extensible neural net before, hoping to probe the space by following more of an evolutionary framework.
# That being the case, I started out using the analog of a planarian worm using its eye dots (which can only sense light and dark) to find food.
# Because of this framework, I'm still trying to figure out how to handle the issue of reward.
# Backpropogation is a strong technical solution, but I need more research to figure out how real brains reinforce the connections between neurons.
# My goal right now, as naive as it is, is to develop a system in which I can add input and output models over time to try and mimic the growth of brains
